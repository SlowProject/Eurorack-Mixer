# Eurorack-Mixer
A four-channel Eurorack mixer (6HP) with two mono outputs

NOTE: 9mm plastic-shaft vertical potentiometers are a better option than metal-shaft ones, 
since the knobs of metal pots take a lot of space. In that case, a nylon spacer should be 
glued between the PCB and the panel for a better stability (see [pics folder](pics))
